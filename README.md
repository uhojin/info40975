## Regression - Abalone Age (Ring + 1.5)

### Abstract
Predicting the age of abalone using physical measurements presents a significant challenge in marine biology and aquaculture. This study employed various machine learning models to predict abalone age through ring count using the UCI Abalone dataset, which contains 4,177 samples with eight physical measurements including sex, dimensional measurements, and various weight attributes. Among 20 regression models tested, the CatBoost Regressor emerged as the superior model, achieving a test RÂ² score of 0.525 and RMSE of 2.135, indicating moderate predictive performance. Feature importance analysis revealed shell weight and shucked weight as the most influential predictors, while sex-related features showed minimal impact. The model exhibited consistent residual distribution across predictions, though with increasing variance at higher predicted values. The final model allows for age estimation by adding 1.5 years to the predicted ring count, providing a practical tool for rapid age assessment in abalone specimens. These findings suggest that while machine learning can assist in age prediction, there remains significant unexplained variance, likely due to environmental and biological factors not captured in physical measurements alone.
